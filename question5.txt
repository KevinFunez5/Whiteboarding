Question #5: Array Sorting
Write an algorithm that sorts an array without using the sort() method. There are many different sorting algorithms - take the time to read about the following:

Quick sort
Merge sort
Heap sort
Insertion sort
Bubble sort
Selection sort
You may implement any of the above algorithms (or your own) to solve the problem - as long as it doesn't use sort().

Example
Input: [9, 2, 7, 12]

Output: [2, 7, 9, 12]

function sort(arr){
  // let sortArr = [];
  var done = false;
  while(!done){
    done = true;
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
      if (arr[i - 1] > arr[i]){
        done = false;
        var temp = arr[i -1];
        arr[i - 1] = arr[i];
        arr[i] = temp;
      }
    }
  }
  return arr;
}
