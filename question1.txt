Question #1: Turning Strings to URLs
URLs cannot have spaces. Instead, all spaces in a string are replaced with %20. Write an algorithm that replaces all spaces in a string with %20.

You may not use the replace() method or regular expressions to solve this problem. Solve the problem with and without recursion.

Example
Input: "Jasmine Ann Jones"

Output: "Jasmine%20Ann%20Jones"

function createURL(str){
  var replace = str.split(" ").join("%20");
  return replace;
}

split methods returns an array of subtrings and the join method replaces those substrings with the string "%20"

"Here I want to start by writing a function that will figure out the empty spaces and add the string "%20" in those empty spaces. in the function ill make a variable that takes the str passed into the function and splits the empty spaces(" ") then will join or add the string "%20"."
