Question #3: Compressing Strings
Write an algorithm that takes a string with repeated characters and compresses them, using a number to show how many times the repeated character has been compressed. For instance, aaa would be written as 3a. Solve the problem with and without recursion.

Example
Input: "aaabccdddda"

Output: "3ab2c4da"

function compressor(input) {
  let output = "";
  let counter = 1;
  let workingBlob = input.split("");
  for (i = 0; i < workingBlob.length; i++) {
    if (workingBlob[i] === workingBlob[i +1]) {
      counter ++;
    } else {
      output += counter + workingBlob[i];
      counter = 1;
    }
  }
    return output.replace(1,"");
}
