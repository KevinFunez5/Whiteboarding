Question #2: Array Deduping
Write an algorithm that removes duplicates from an array. Do not use a function like filter() to solve this. Once you have solved the problem, demonstrate how it can be solved with filter(). Solve the problem with and without recursion.

Example
Input: [7, 9, "hi", 12, "hi" 7, 53]

Output: [7, 9, "hi", 12, 53]

let chars = ['A', 'B', 'A', 'C', 'B'];

let uniqueChars = [];
chars.forEach((c) => {
    if (!uniqueChars.includes(c)) {
        uniqueChars.push(c);
    }
});

console.log(uniqueChars);


the loop will iterate through the char array and if the array (uniqueChars) does not include the character/index it will push that character into the uniqueChar array. And if that character does exist it wont push it!
